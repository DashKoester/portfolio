      "description": "The Spatial Cognition Lab was the first research lab I worked in at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I worked primarily under the graduate student Meera Zukosky. The purpose of the study was to calculate approximately how long a person can focus on a specific cognitive task before their attention breaks and shifts elsewhere. I was one of the two research assistants who guided participants through the experiment and recorded the results. We utilized O-Span tests and other interactive programs to track and record participant results.",

      "description": "The second lab I worked in was the Center for Parent-Child Studies. I was primarily supervised by graduate student Janet Ng. We worked with a sister laboratory located in Hong Kong, China to determine the quantifiable cultural differences in parenting styles between American and Eastern-Asian parents. I conducted the section of the experiment involving the child participants. I provided guidance, recorded the results, and presented the results to each child's parent. For the parent section of the experiment, I transcribed and analyzed video recorded parent responses. I used Excel spreadsheets extensively to compile my analysis. The early stages of the study indicated that American parents were much more focused on their childâ€™s self-worth and confidence, whereas the Asian parents focused more on their children improving on the task.",

      "title": "Decision Neuroscience Laboratory",
      "director": "Dr. Aron K. Barbey",
      "timeframe": "February 2017 - August 2017",
      "description": "I most recently worked in the Decision Neuroscience Lab at the renowned Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology. During my work under the supervision of Post-Doctoral Fellow Chris Zwilling, I had the opportunity to integrate computer science and neuroscience research. I was chosen to contribute to two projects. The first was a Nutritional Cognitive Enhancement study, testing the effects of dietary supplements on focus and cognition. I was the sole undergraduate Research Assistant working on a Cognitive Chronobiology study, exploring the cognitive effects of circadian rhythms and time of day. I will be credited as a co-author on the Chronobiology paper when it is published. For both projects, I wrote the data analysis in R, a statistical computing scripting language. In addition to developing the data analysis, I created multiple graphs and spreadsheets for the Lab Director to use while presenting the project to financiers and journal editors.",
